Instructions for running the bbl example

This example is designed to demonstrate running constant-pH MD using 
NAMD's GPU-resident code path.

There are two new config file parameters:

cphUseGpu           on   ;# use GPU-resident code path
cphNumEquilMDSteps  1000 ;# minimize with MD 0.1 fs timestepping at 0K

In order to run, you need both a GPU-resident build and a CPU-only build 
for running psfgen. You also need to define environment variables that will 
be used by the control scripts. Note that catdcd is available through VMD. 
Example settings below demonstrate environment definitions for running bbl.

$ export CPU_PATH=/path/to/cpu-only-build/namd3
$ export GPU_PATH=/path/to/gpu-resident-build/namd3
$ export CONFIG_FILE=bbl.namd
$ export CATDCD_PATH=/path/to/catdcd
$ export NUM_THREADS=1

For this small system (~13.3k atoms), you get much better performance using 
just 1 CPU core. A possible rule-of-thumb on modern CPUs is 1 core for every 
25k atoms. Scheduling too many cores without a sufficient amount of work per 
core degrades performance. 

After defining the environment variables above, run as follows:

$ $CPU_PATH +p$NUM_THREADS +setcpuaffinity $CONFIG_FILE

You can also modify the config file to use the standard minimizer rather 
than performing short time stepping at low temperature

Running

$ time $CPU_PATH +p$NUM_THREADS +setcpuaffinity $CONFIG_FILE

measured the following total runtimes for NVIDIA A6000 GPU workstation:

Total time for cphNumMinSteps=200:       2m47s
Total time for cphNumEquilMDSteps=1000:  2m20s

Equilibrium dynamics simulation performed in the range of 220-250 ns/day.
Non-equilibrium switching performed in the range of 115-120 ns/day.
